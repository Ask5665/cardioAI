# cardioAI
CardioAI is an advanced deep learning system designed to analyze ECG (electrocardiogram) signals and detect potential heart conditions in real time. Using a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, the model processes both 2-lead and 12-lead ECG data to identify abnormal patterns, classify arrhythmias, and assess cardiac health.
